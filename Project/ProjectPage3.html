        <h1>Blockchain Voting</h1>
        <img src="../Images/blockchain4.png">
    <p>Once this technology has gotten more attention others realized it can be used for many other things such as; medical records, contracts, collecting taxes, real estate, voting and much more.</p> 
    <p>Voting in general is a very heated topic for debate in this past election and this type of uncertainty can be extremely dangerous to the structure of our society. We have talks of other countries fixing our elections, ballots disappearing or found in ditches across the country, and voter suppression of lower income areas who cannot wait in line for hours just to write in a single ballot. Why do we settle for such a system that most people can agree is dangerously outdated?</p>
    <p>With blockchain people would be able to vote seamlessly from home or any device that could be connected to the blockchains per to per network within seconds. In 2016 we had a 56% voter turnout, this means that a little less than half of our population did not even cast a ballot to vote, we have a significantly lower voter turnout than most other developed nation. With a system where you can vote from your phone in seconds it would give a greater voice to people who maybe could not make it to vote, or people who just don’t feel as if they’re vote really matters.</p>
