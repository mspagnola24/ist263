    <p>Each block within the chain contains; the data that has been inputted, the hash, and the previous blocks hash. The data in each block depends on what type of blockchain it is. For example, Bitcoins blockchain keeps a record of the sender, receiver, and how many coins have been transacted. The hash is to identify each block and the contents within it. The hash is a long list of randomly assorted letters and numbers that is completely individual to each block within the chain. The best way to describe how a hash functions is similar to a fingerprint; it identifies the individual block and is always unique. If the data in the block is changed the hash will change with it creating a completely different block with a new fingerprint than before. <p> 
    
    <p>The third element inside each block is the (fingerprint) or hash of the previous block. This image is a real depiction of what an actual blockchain looks like. This system essentially creates a chain of blocks that have their own fingerprint and each block holds prior fingerprints before it as well, this is one of the reasons that blockchain is so secure. Even if one block in the chain happened to be tampered with the blockchain would immediately pick up this error because all of the following blocks will no longer store a valid hash of the previous block. </p>
