        <h1>What is Blockchain?</h1>
    <p>I have created this webpage to discuss blockchain technology and how this technology can reshape the way we do our democratic processes in this country and around the globe.<p> 
    <p>Most people when they hear blockchain immediately think of its most famous application which is Bitcoin which was created using blockchain technology in 2009. We can have an entirely different Ted Talk on Cryptocurrencies and its growing importance in the real world but for now I am focusing on Blockchain as a whole and what this technology means for the future of our society.<p>
    <p>What is blockchain exactly, how do they work, what problems does it solve and how can it be used? Like the name indicates a blockchain is a chain of blocks that hold information. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is open to everyone on a per to per network, once data has been added to the blockchain it becomes very difficult to change it. To understand this, we must look closer into an individual block.</p>
